                    <p>No way I can even go a whole day without it. I have been playing guitar since I was 13 and use it as my meditation at the end the day. My preferred genre is all types of metal, however it's not the only genre I listen to. I love music that has great flow. For the past few months I've been working with this local metal band that is just as passionate as making music as I am.</p>

                    <h3>Games</h3>
                    
                    <p>Video games have been a part of my life since I was very young. My dad owned a few arcades during my childhood, so naturally I haven't grown out playing when I can. My favorite type of video game are RPGs, mainly because I love adventure, action and above all great stories. My love for games is the biggest reason that I got into coding. In my past times I like to make classic arcade games with the Phaser framework that uses JavaScript.</p>

                    <h3>Coding</h3>
                    
                    <p>My love for video games as mentioned above is one of my biggest influences next to my oldest brother whose  been coding for 20+ years. When I was in high school I moved to new school who had a web development class and since I had a free period I took it not knowing what to expect. The idea that some written words of magic that the computer seemed to understand and tranform into a work of art was something that I instantly fell in love with. It wasn't until I got to Salt Lake Community College did I learn more about the web and the languages that make it work and seem to have become addicted to learning more!</p>

                    <h3>Books</h3>
                    
                    <p>During grade school I never appreciated what a book could really do for you. It wasn't until I moved out of my parents and was learning that life is much different on your own. Luckily I had made an amazing friend that lent me &quot;Star Wars: Darth Bane Path of Destruction&quot;, which completely changed my life honestly. This book taught me that knowledge is power and you should never stop seeking both knowledge and understanding. Since then books have become a huge part in what makes me, me. Imagination and passion are things I cherish deeply, becuase I feel that without those life seems less colorful.</p>
